TodoList-v2

This is a simple todo list application that allows the user to create different todo lists and add "todos" to them to help remember what the user needs to do. A user can "add" a todo, and "remove" it onces its completed. A user can also create a new independent todo list by adding to the url. This will then create a new todolist at the specific route that can then be changed independently of other lists.
